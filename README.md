Encrypt and decrypt messages with symmetric encryption.
Simulated TUI environment using ANSI escape codes an ~~unnecessary~~ FFI

ECDSA-like key derviation, and ChaCha20 for message encryption/decryption.

NOTE: Because of the simple key derivation, simple secrets can easily be bruteforced. use a long secret with random symbols
